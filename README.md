# odin-recipes
Start:
This is my first project with The Odin Project. I will be attempting to create a basic HTML wedsite to show different recipes.
    The skills I will be implementing are setting up the main index page as well as adding a few links.

I was able to utlize the the skills learned from this section well. I set up the index page with the correct information, then created additional recipe pages all linked to the main. I am excited to expand my knowledge and continue to grow my skills.
